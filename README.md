# Spirograph

Turtle is a pre-installed Python library that enables users to create pictures and shapes by providing them with a virtual canvas. The onscreen pen that you use for drawing is called the turtle and this is what gives the library its name. In short, the Python turtle library helps new programmers get a feel for what programming with Python is like in a fun and interactive way.

Getting Started With turtle
Before you continue, there are two important things that you’ll need to do to make the most of this tutorial:

Python Environment: Make sure that you’re familiar with your programming environment. You can use applications like IDLE or Jupyter Notebook to program with turtle. However, if you’re not comfortable with them, then you can program with the REPL.

Python Version: Ensure that you have version 3 of Python on your computer. If not, then you can download it from the Python website. For help setting things up, check out Python 3 Installation & Setup Guide.
